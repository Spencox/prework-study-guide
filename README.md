# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was created to help a student(you), keep track of new notes and topics related to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It allows a simple user interface to review notes and logs the subjects learned in the course along with a recommendation on which technology to study. It helped me learn how to use basic HTML, CSS, Git and Github, and Javascript in one project.

If you open op the browser development tools by using CTRL+I(Windows) or Command+Option+I(MacOS) you can see a list of topics for the study guide and a recommended topic to start learning for the day.
